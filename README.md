# Medical Image Segmentation Using Convolutional Neurals Networks (CNNs)

This model was inspired by the U-Net Architecture 

Object Recognition and Detection: Segmentation helps in identifying and 
distinguishing different objects or regions within an image, which is crucial for 
applications like object detection and recognition in computer vision systems.

Medical Imaging: In medical imaging, segmentation is used to identify and delineate 
structures like organs, tumours, or bones, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and 
medical research.
